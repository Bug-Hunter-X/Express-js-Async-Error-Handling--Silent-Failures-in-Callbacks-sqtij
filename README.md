# Express.js Async Error Handling: Silent Failures in Callbacks

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: improper handling of asynchronous operations leading to silent failures.  The example showcases an asynchronous data fetching function that may fail, but the failure is not explicitly handled, leading to an application crash or an unexpected behavior.  The solution offers a more robust approach using Promises or async/await for better error management.

## Bug

The `getData` function simulates an asynchronous operation that sometimes fails. If it fails (randomly in this case), the callback receives `null`, resulting in a silent failure. The application doesn't provide feedback to the user about the issue. 

## Solution

The solution uses promises to handle asynchronous data fetching in a more robust way, using .catch() to handle rejection. This ensures better error handling and prevents silent failures.
